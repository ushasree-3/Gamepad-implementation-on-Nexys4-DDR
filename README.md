# Two Cars Game on Nexys4 DDR Board

## Overview
This project implements the "Two Cars" game on the Nexys4 DDR FPGA board. The game involves controlling two cars simultaneously to avoid squares and collect circles for score increment. The score is displayed using a seven-segment display on the FPGA.

## Features Implemented
- **Gameplay Mechanics:**
  - Control two cars independently to avoid squares and collect circles.
  - Game over if a car hits a square.
  - Score increases with each collected circle.
  
- **User Interface:**
  - Start screen with game instructions.
  - Game over screen displaying final score.
  
- **Visuals:**

## Future Enhancements
- **Power-Ups:**
  - Introduce power-ups for temporary advantages.
  
- **Audio:**
  - Add sound effects and background music to enhance the gaming experience.
  
- **Multiple Levels:**
  - Create different levels with unique layouts or themes.
  
- **Difficulty Levels:**
  - Implement various difficulty levels to cater to different player skills.
